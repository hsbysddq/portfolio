          Hello! My name is Brittany and I enjoy creating things that live on
          the internet. My interest in web development started back in 2012 when
          I decided to try editing custom Tumblr themes — turns out hacking
          together a custom reblog button taught me a lot about HTML & CSS!
          <br />
          <br /> Fast-forward to today, and I’ve had the privilege of working at
          an advertising agency, a start-up, a huge corporation, and a
          student-led design studio. My main focus these days is building
          accessible, inclusive products and digital experiences at Upstatement
          for a variety of clients. <br />
          <br /> I also recently launched a course that covers everything you
          need to build a web app with the Spotify API using Node & React.
